2.1.0 (unreleased)
==================

**API changes**

- Spiking ``LIF`` neuron models now accept an additional argument,
  ``min_voltage``. Voltages are clipped such that they do not drop below
  this value (previously, this was fixed at 0).
  (`#666 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/666>`_)
- ``Process`` objects can now be passed directly as node outputs,
  making them easier to use. The ``Process`` interface is also improved
  and is currently the same as the ``Synapse`` interface. However,
  further improvements are pending, and the current implementation
  SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED!
  (`#652 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/652>`_)
- The ``PES`` learning rule no longer accepts a connection as an argument.
  Instead, error information is transmitted by making a connection to the
  learning rule object (e.g.,
  ``nengo.Connection(error_ensemble, connection.learning_rule)``.
  (`#344 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/344>`_,
  `#642 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/642>`_)
- The ``modulatory`` attribute has been removed from ``nengo.Connection``.
  This was only used for learning rules to this point, and has been removed
  in favor of connecting directly to the learning rule.
  (`#642 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/642>`_)
- Connection weights can now be probed with ``nengo.Probe(conn, 'weights')``,
  and these are always the weights that will change with learning
  regardless of the type of connection. Previously, either ``decoders`` or
  ``transform`` may have changed depending on the type of connection;
  it is now no longer possible to probe ``decoders`` or ``transform``.
  (`#729 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/729>`_)
- A version of the AssociativeMemory SPA module is now available as a
  stand-alone network in ``nengo.networks``. The AssociativeMemory SPA module
  also has an updated argument list.
  (`#702 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/702>`_)
- The ``Product`` and ``InputGatedMemory`` networks no longer accept a
  ``config`` argument. (`#814 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/814>`_)
- The ``EnsembleArray`` network's ``neuron_nodes`` argument is deprecated.
  Instead, call the new ``add_neuron_input`` or ``add_neuron_output`` methods.
  (`#868 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/868>`_)
- The ``nengo.log`` utility function now takes a string ``level`` parameter
  to specify any logging level, instead of the old binary ``debug`` parameter.
  Cache messages are logged at DEBUG instead of INFO level.
  (`#883 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/883>`_)
- Reorganised the Associative Memory code, including removing many extra
  parameters from ``nengo.networks.assoc_mem.AssociativeMemory`` and modifying
  the defaults of others.
  (`#797 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/797>`_)
- Add ``close`` method to ``Simulator``. ``Simulator`` can now be used
  used as a context manager.
  (`#857 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/857`_,
  `#739 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/739>`_,
  `#859 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/859>`_)

**Behavioural changes**

- The sign on the ``PES`` learning rule's error has been flipped to conform
  with most learning rules, in which error is minimized. The error should be
  ``actual - target``. (`#642 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/642>`_)
- The ``PES`` rule's learning rate is invariant to the number of neurons
  in the presynaptic population. The effective speed of learning should now
  be unaffected by changes in the size of the presynaptic population.
  Existing learning networks may need to be updated; to achieve identical
  behavior, scale the learning rate by ``pre.n_neurons / 100``.
  (`#643 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/643>`_)
- The ``probeable`` attribute of all Nengo objects is now implemented
  as a property, rather than a configurable parameter.
  (`#671 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/671>`_)
- Node functions receive ``x`` as a copied NumPy array (instead of a readonly
  view).
  (`#716 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/716>`_,
  `#722 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/722>`_)
- The SPA Compare module produces a scalar output (instead of a specific
  vector).
  (`#775 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/775>`_,
  `#782 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/782>`_)
- Bias nodes in ``spa.Cortical``, and gate ensembles and connections in
  ``spa.Thalamus`` are now stored in the target modules.
  (`#894 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/894>`_,
  `#906 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/906>`_)

**Improvements**

- Added a ``randomized_svd`` subsolver for the L2 solvers. This can be much
  quicker for large numbers of neurons or evaluation points.
  (`#803 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/803>`_)
- Added ``PES.pre_tau`` attribute, which sets the time constant on a lowpass
  filter of the presynaptic activity.
  (`#643 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/643>`_)
- ``EnsembleArray.add_output`` now accepts a list of functions
  to be computed by each ensemble.
  (`#562 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/562>`_,
  `#580 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/580>`_)
- ``LinearFilter`` now has an ``analog`` argument which can be set
  through its constructor. Linear filters with digital coefficients
  can be specified by setting ``analog`` to ``False``.
  (`#819 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/819>`_)
- Added ``SqrtBeta`` distribution, which describes the distribution
  of semantic pointer elements.
  (`#414 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/414>`_,
  `#430 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/430>`_)
- Added ``Triangle`` synapse, which filters with a triangular FIR filter.
  (`#660 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/660>`_)
- Added ``utils.connection.eval_point_decoding`` function, which
  provides a connection's static decoding of a list of evaluation points.
  (`#700 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/700>`_)
- Resetting the Simulator now resets all Processes, meaning the
  injected random signals and noise are identical between runs,
  unless the seed is changed (which can be done through
  ``Simulator.reset``).
  (`#582 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/582>`_,
  `#616 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/616>`_,
  `#652 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/652>`_)
- An exception is raised if SPA modules are not properly assigned to an SPA
  attribute.
  (`#730 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/730>`_,
  `#791 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/791>`_)
- The ``Product`` network is now more accurate.
  (`#651 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/651>`_)
- Numpy arrays can now be used as indices for slicing objects.
  (`#754 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/754>`_)
- ``Config.configures`` now accepts multiple classes rather than
  just one. (`#842 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/842>`_)
- Added ``add`` method to ``spa.Actions``, which allows
  actions to be added after module has been initialized.
  (`#861 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/861>`_,
  `#862 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/862>`_)
- Added SPA wrapper for circular convolution networks, ``spa.Bind``
  (`#849 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/849>`_)
- Added the ``Voja`` (Vector Oja) learning rule type, which updates an
  ensemble's encoders to fire selectively for its inputs. (see
  ``examples/learning/learn_associations.ipynb``).
  (`#727 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/727>`_)
- Added a clipped exponential distribution useful for thresholding, in
  particular in the AssociativeMemory.
  (`#582 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/779>`_)
- Added a cosine similarity distribution, which is the distribution of the
  cosine of the angle between two random vectors. It is useful for setting
  intercepts, in particular when using the ``Voja`` learning rule.
  (`#768 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/768>`_)
- Improved the default ``LIF`` neuron model to spike at the same rate as the
  ``LIFRate`` neuron model for constant inputs. The older model has been
  renamed to ``FastLIF``.
  (`#975 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/975>`_)

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed issue where setting ``Connection.seed`` through the constructor had
  no effect. (`#724 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/725>`_)
- Fixed issue in which learning connections could not be sliced.
  (`#632 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/632>`_)
- Fixed issue when probing scalar transforms.
  (`#667 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/667>`_,
  `#671 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/671>`_)
- Fix for SPA actions that route to a module with multiple inputs.
  (`#714 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/714>`_)
- Corrected the ``rmses`` values in ``BuiltConnection.solver_info`` when using
  ``NNls`` and ``Nnl2sL2`` solvers, and the ``reg`` argument for ``Nnl2sL2``.
  (`#839 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/839>`_)
- ``spa.Vocabulary.create_pointer`` now respects the specified number of
  creation attempts, and returns the most dissimilar pointer if none can be
  found below the similarity threshold.
  (`#817 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/817>`_)
