    Attributes
    ----------
    config : Config instance or None
        Build functions can set a config object here to affect sub-builders.
    decoder_cache : DecoderCache instance
        An object that will be used to cache decoders for faster builds.
    dt : float
        The length of each timestep, in seconds.
    label : str or None
        A name or description to differentiate different models.
    operators : list of Operator instances
        List of all operators created in the build process.
        All operators must be added to this list, as it is used by Simulator.
    params : dict (NengoObject -> namedtuple)
        Mapping from objects to namedtuples containing parameters generated
        in the build process.
    probes : list of Probe
        List of all probes. Probes must be added to this list in the build
        process, as this list is used by Simulator.
    seeded : dict (NengoObject -> bool)
        All objects are assigned a seed, whether the user defined the seed
        or it was automatically generated. 'seeded' keeps track of whether
        the seed is user-defined. We consider the seed to be user-defined
        if it was set directly on the object, or if a seed was set on the
        network in which the object resides, or if a seed was set on any
        ancestor network of the network in which the object resides.
    seeds : dict (NengoObject -> int)
        Mapping from objects to the integer seed assigned to that object.
    sig : dict (str -> dict (object -> Signal))
        A dictionary of dictionaries that organizes all of the signals
        created in the build process, as build functions often need to
        access signals created by other build functions.
    step : Signal(dtype=int64)
        The current step (i.e., how many timesteps have occurred thus far).
    time : Signal(dtype=float64)
        The current point in time.
    toplevel : Network instance
        The top-level network being built.
        This is sometimes useful for accessing network elements after build,
        or for the network builder to determine if it is the top-level network.
